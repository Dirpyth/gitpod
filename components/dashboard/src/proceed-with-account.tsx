                    <p>
                        Ideally, you would proceed with a single account and connect with both providers. To make a well considered decision, please review the contents and subscriptions of both accounts.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can <a href={logoutUrl}>re-login with {otherUser.authHost}</a> to switch to your other account ({otherUser.name}). Feel free to disconnect the providers from the no longer required account and connect them with your main account afterwards.
